# MODX MCP

**MODX MCP** is an MCP server (**Model Context Protocol**) and component line for **MODX Revolution 2.8.x and 3.x**. It lets AI agents work through MODX objects, processors, permissions and relations instead of treating a site as only a database and a set of files.

> **MODX MCP does not try to give AI the widest possible access to a website. It tries to give AI the right access to MODX.**

The project is based on the original [**modxMCP**](https://github.com/dampilov94/mcp-component), created by [**dampilov94**](https://github.com/dampilov94). The current codebase grew out of the MODX 3 port and now uses one shared modular runtime with platform adapters for MODX 2 and MODX 3.

**MODX MCP 1.2.0 · MODX Revolution 2.8.x / 3.x · 192/192 server actions · MIT**

> The repository name `modx3-mcp`, Node package name, and existing technical identifiers are retained for backward compatibility. The product name shown in documentation and the MODX manager is now **MODX MCP**.


## The idea

Giving an AI agent normal server access means it can edit files, run SQL queries, and execute commands. For MODX, that is not enough. A large part of a MODX site lives in resources, templates, chunks, snippets, TVs, system settings, relations between objects, and data managed by installed extras.

MODX MCP gives the agent a dedicated management layer that works with these things as MODX objects. The agent can:

- find resources, templates, chunks, snippets, plugins, and TVs;
- inspect dependencies and where elements are used;
- create, update, and delete MODX objects through controlled operations;
- work with system settings, media sources, and supported extras;
- preview potentially dangerous operations before applying them;
- create safety backups before changes;
- keep read operations separate from write operations;
- send information about completed changes to an external audit log.

The main goal is to make AI work with MODX more **predictable, reviewable, and reversible**.

## Who is it for?

MODX MCP is mainly useful for:

- MODX developers and integrators who use AI agents in daily work;
- agencies and teams that maintain several MODX projects;
- owners of complex MODX sites who want controlled AI access to the CMS;
- developers of their own agent systems who need more than generic file, SSH, or database access.

## Why MODX MCP is designed this way

MODX MCP was not built as a demo showing that an LLM can be connected to a CMS. It was built as a practical tool for working with real websites.

The main risk with an AI agent is not whether it can change a file or a record. The real question is whether it understands the consequences. On a live MODX site, elements rarely exist in isolation. One shared chunk may be used by dozens of resources and templates, a TV may be part of the logic of several sections, and a system setting may affect an entire component.

That is why MODX MCP focuses not only on executing commands, but also on context: dependencies, previews, backups, limits for dangerous operations, and auditing.

The goal is not to make the agent all-powerful. The goal is to give it enough context and enough limits so it is less likely to make dangerous decisions blindly.

## Development environment and agent architecture

MODX MCP was developed and tested as part of a real agent-based workflow used for practical website maintenance.

For communication between the AI agent and the messaging layer, we used the open-source project [**cc-connect**](https://github.com/chenhg5/cc-connect), created by [**Glenn (chenhg5)**](https://github.com/chenhg5).

In our own workflow, the external interface is built with a **custom Telegram bot and custom server-side scripts**. These tools are kept in a private repository because they are part of our internal infrastructure and our own know-how.

> **MODX MCP is a server and a set of tools for an agent. It is not a ready-made agent and it is not tied to Telegram.**

The Node.js part of MODX MCP runs as a local MCP server over `stdio`. This means it can be used with any client or agent environment that can start and connect to this type of MCP server: an IDE, a custom agent, an automation system, or a compatible chat interface.

You can write your own agent instructions and define your own rules for how the agent should work with MODX MCP. The Telegram bot is only one interface used in our own workflow.

Another part of our internal setup is **AGENT.md** — our own set of system instructions, restrictions, and working rules for an AI agent. It was developed from more than two years of practical work with websites using AI. Some of these rules directly influenced the architecture of MODX MCP: dependency analysis, separation of reads and writes, backups, limits around dangerous actions, and auditing.

The Telegram bot, server-side scripts, and AGENT.md are **not dependencies of MODX MCP** and are not required to install or use it.

## Common AI mistakes when working with a CMS

| Common problem | What can happen | What MODX MCP does |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Changing an element without checking where it is used | A shared chunk, snippet, or TV affects several parts of the site | Lets the agent inspect dependencies and usage |
| Editing the database directly | MODX logic may be bypassed, relations may break, or cache state may become incorrect | Provides dedicated operations for MODX objects |
| Deleting an "unused" object without checking | A hidden dependency is discovered only after part of the site breaks | Helps inspect relations and possible impact before deletion |
| Overwriting settings during an update | API tokens or site-specific values are lost | Preserves existing settings during reinstall and upgrade |
| Several changes running at the same time | One process may overwrite the result of another | Uses locking for write operations |
| Failure during a component upgrade | The component may be left only partly updated | Prepares the new file tree separately and restores the previous one on failure |
| Giving the agent too much access | A mistake affects more objects than necessary | Lets you disable and restrict capability groups |
| No action history | It becomes difficult to understand what the agent actually changed | Supports an external operation log and audit data |

## How this approach is different

MODX MCP does not replace SSH, SQL, or file access. It solves a different problem: it gives AI an interface where MODX objects still keep their meaning.

| Approach | What the agent gets | Main limitation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SSH and shell access | Broad access to the server and system commands | Wide permissions, but little understanding of CMS structure |
| Direct SQL access | Read and write access to database tables | Bypasses application logic and gives little context about object relations |
| Generic file MCP | Access to source code and the file system | A large part of MODX structure is not stored in files |
| Generic database MCP | Access to tables and queries | Tables do not explain MODX object semantics to the agent |
| MODX MCP | Dedicated operations for MODX entities and their relations | The agent is limited to capabilities explicitly implemented and allowed by the server |

MODX MCP deliberately does not give AI arbitrary access to the whole server. Instead, it gives the agent a narrower but more meaningful interface: a resource stays a resource, a chunk stays a chunk, a TV stays a TV, and dependencies between them can be inspected before a change is made.

## Example task

For example, you can ask an agent:

> "Increase the price of products in a specific category by 100. First find where the price is stored, check which objects will be affected, and only then make the changes."

Instead of editing database tables directly, the agent can use MODX MCP to inspect the project structure, identify the right entities, review related objects, perform the change through available operations, and record the result.

## Features

The server side of MODX MCP exposes more than 180 operations, which the client presents as specialised MCP tools.

It supports:

- resources and the site tree;
- templates, chunks, and snippets;
- plugins and events;
- TVs and TV values;
- categories and system settings;
- namespaces;
- media sources and files;
- user groups and access control;
- property sets and contexts;
- packages, extras, and lexicons;
- MIGX, miniShop2, VersionX, and VirtualPage.

Individual capability groups can be disabled in the component settings.

## Dependency analysis

One of the key features of MODX MCP is a dependency graph for site elements.

[![MODX MCP dependency graph](docs/images/dependency-graph.png)](docs/images/dependency-graph.png)

*MODX MCP dependency graph in the MODX manager: relations between templates, chunks, snippets, TVs, and plugins, plus detected broken references and unused elements.*

The agent can find:

- which chunks and snippets are used by a template;
- which TVs are assigned to templates;
- which elements call other elements;
- where a specific element is used;
- references to elements that do not exist;
- elements that are likely no longer used;
- which parts of the site may be affected by a change.

The graph is available through MCP and also as a dedicated screen in the MODX manager. This is especially useful on larger projects, where changing one element may affect several different sections of the site.

## Safety mechanisms

MODX MCP is designed not only for reading data, but also for real work on live websites. Depending on the operation, it supports:

- automatic safety backups before changes;
- previewing changes without applying them;
- extra confirmation for destructive operations;
- locking of parallel write operations;
- restricting available capability groups;
- separate permission for running arbitrary MODX processors;
- HTTPS required for the API by default;
- safe API-token comparison;
- automatic selection of an active MODX user with `sudo` permission;
- preservation of existing settings and API token during component upgrades.

## Limits and trust model

MODX MCP does not make AI error-free. An LLM can still misunderstand a task, select the wrong object, or suggest an unwanted change.

The component reduces technical risk and gives the agent more context, but it does not replace proper backups, access control, or human review of critical changes. Extra care is recommended for bulk operations, access-control changes, system settings, custom PHP code, and operations provided by third-party extras.

On a production site, it is best to allow only the capability groups that are actually needed.

## External audit hook

For integration with your own audit system, the client supports the `MODX_MCP_AUDIT_HOOK` environment variable.

After a successful write operation, the client can start a configured local program and send JSON to its standard input. The payload includes the MCP tool name, arguments, result, site identifier, actor information, and paths to automatically created safety backups.

The program is started directly, without a shell. If the audit hook is not configured, normal MODX MCP behaviour does not change. If the hook itself fails, an already successful site change is not reported as failed. Read-only operations do not trigger the hook.

## Compatibility

Version 1.2.0 continues the shared-source line for both supported MODX generations:

- **MODX Revolution 2.8.x** — platform artifact `modx2`;
- **MODX Revolution 3.x** — platform artifact `modx3`;
- **Node.js 18 or newer** for the local MCP server.

The two MODX generations use the same MCP client, the same public action contract and the same modular runtime. Platform-specific bootstrap, class names and processor routing are isolated behind platform adapters and release overlays.

Version 1.2.0 status:

- all **192/192** server actions are implemented by the modular runtime; compared with v1.1.0, version 1.2.0 adds 10 actions: `get_site_state`, ClientConfig CRUD/read operations, and additional access-policy/resource-group read helpers;
- the 192-action source contract passes the static architecture, client/server, migration, portability and release-staging checks;
- the published **v1.1.0** release was live-validated with the previous **182-action** contract on MODX 3.2.4-pl and MODX 2.8.9-pl;
- MODX 3 processor compatibility for the stable line was checked against 3.2.2-pl, 3.2.4-pl and the then-current 3.x branch;
- **v1.2.0 is the current stable release**. Static release checks, Runtime-CAS smoke, platform transport release-smoke and the current 81-action read parity passed on MODX 3.2.4-pl and MODX 2.8.9-pl; the complete 14-suite live regression passed on MODX 3, while MODX 2 passed the core/runtime matrix with positive MIGX lifecycle skipped because MIGX is not installed on that sandbox.

See [build architecture](docs/BUILD-ARCHITECTURE.md) and [validation status](docs/VALIDATION.md) for the exact matrix.

## Quick start

A minimal working setup is:

1. Install the MODX MCP transport package.
2. Get the automatically generated API token.
3. Configure your MCP client to start MODX MCP.
4. Begin with a safe read-only task, for example: "Show me the project structure and the dependencies of template X."

After that, you can move to more complex workflows and enable only the capability groups you actually need.

## Install with the MODX transport package

Version 1.2.0 produces two platform-specific transport packages from the same source tree:

- MODX 2.8.x: `modxmcp-1.2.0-pl.transport.zip`;
- MODX 3.x: `modx3mcp-1.2.0-pl.transport.zip`.

Install only the package that matches the MODX major version. Both packages install the same `modxmcp` namespace, settings, MCP endpoint and modular action surface.

Existing `modxmcp.*` settings and the API token are preserved during reinstall or upgrade.

Version **1.2.0** is the current published stable GitHub release.

## Command-line installation

The source repository defaults to the MODX 3 build. For an explicit platform build, first create a clean release tree.

MODX 3:

```bash
python3 _build/prepare-release.py --platform modx3 --output /tmp/modxmcp-modx3
cd /tmp/modxmcp-modx3
MODX_CONFIG_CORE=/full/path/to/config.core.php php _build/install.headless.php
```

MODX 2:

```bash
python3 _build/prepare-release.py --platform modx2 --output /tmp/modxmcp-modx2
cd /tmp/modxmcp-modx2
MODX_CONFIG_CORE=/full/path/to/config.core.php php _build/install.headless.php
```

The prepared tree contains only the selected platform fallback/bootstrap and no source-only legacy/platform templates.

The installer creates the required settings and manager entries and generates an API token when needed. New files are staged before live directories are replaced; existing settings and tokens are preserved on upgrade.

## Configure an MCP client

After version 1.2.0 is published, pin the release tag:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "modx": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "-y",
        "github:rumata-estor/modx3-mcp#v1.2.0"
      ],
      "env": {
        "MODX_MCP_SITE_URL": "https://example.com/assets/components/modxmcp/api.php",
        "MODX_MCP_TOKEN": "your-token"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

The Node.js client is the same for MODX 2 and MODX 3; only the server-side transport package differs.

For development or pre-release testing, use:

```text
github:rumata-estor/modx3-mcp#main
```

For production sites, pin a published release tag.

## Release checks

Before a release, the project checks:

- PHP syntax and Node.js client syntax;
- version consistency across the shared source and both platform build configs;
- the complete client/server contract: **192 actions**;
- modular migration coverage: **81/81 reads + 111/111 mutations**;
- MODX 2 platform staging and PHP compatibility;
- MODX 3 processor compatibility across 3.2.2-pl, 3.2.4-pl and current 3.x;
- installation portability, secure defaults and platform-specific transport requirements;
- install/reinstall/uninstall smoke cycles on a separate site of the matching MODX major version.

Prepare a platform tree before running a full release smoke for that platform. Never run the destructive release cycle on a production site.

## Project origin

MODX MCP is based on the open-source [**modxMCP**](https://github.com/dampilov94/mcp-component) project, created by [**dampilov94**](https://github.com/dampilov94).

The original work and attribution are preserved in the project history and license. MODX MCP develops that base into a shared MODX 2/3 platform for practical AI-agent work, with dependency analysis, controlled write operations, backups, auditing and platform-specific adapters.

## License and release

The project is distributed under the **MIT License**. See [LICENSE](LICENSE).

Current stable version: **1.2.0**.

Latest published stable release: **[1.2.0](https://github.com/rumata-estor/modx3-mcp/releases/tag/v1.2.0)**.

The 1.2.0 release includes GitHub source archives, separate MODX 2 and MODX 3 transport packages, and their SHA-256 checksums.

---

MODX MCP can be installed and configured independently using the documentation. In real projects, integration often needs additional work around access permissions, safe workflows, backups, auditing, third-party extras, and the structure of a particular site. This usually requires separate engineering work for the specific project.
